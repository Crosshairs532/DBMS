### What is PostgreSQL?

```md
PostgreSql is a object oriented open source relational database management system.  
Using object-oriented features of PostgreSQL, programmers can:

- Communicate with the database servers using objects in their code.
- Define complex custom data types.
- Define functions that work with their own data types.
- Define inheritance, or parent-child relationships, between tables.
```
